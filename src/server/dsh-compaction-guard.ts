/**
 * #1729: dsh native compaction-call guard.
 *
 * dsh's `dsh-compaction-basic` answers context pressure by replaying the whole
 * conversation prefix and appending a fixed summarization directive
 * (COMPACTION_INSTRUCTION, dsh-compaction-basic/lib/index.js) as the FINAL
 * user message, reusing the same session id so the provider's KV prefix cache
 * stays warm. In the desktop lane those calls ride bili under the main
 * conversation id — the second producer of #1729's deadlock — and when one
 * LANDS, dsh durably shadows the replayed surface range: the original
 * messages never ride a future request again, which destroys the proxy's
 * compression substrate (irreversible, unlike every cost of refusing).
 *
 * This guard identifies the call at the traffic level and refuses it locally:
 * never forwarded, kernel state untouched. MARKER-DECISIVE (#2193): the final
 * user message STARTS with the versioned instruction prefix (machine-appended
 * by the summarizer, never user-chosen in practice) and that is sufficient on
 * its own. The original two-signal AND carried a SHAPE bar (≤4 messages,
 * pinned to rc.1-era observations — 2 msgs at ~152K tokens in the #1727/#1729
 * logs); dsh-compaction-basic 0.2.0-rc.2 changed the summarize call to replay
 * the ENTIRE shadowed region as the message prefix (~1100+ messages), which
 * made SHAPE permanently false and the whole guard silently pass through — a
 * landed checkpoint then durably shadowed the raw history of a live session
 * (#2193). The failure direction of an extra shape signal is exactly what
 * hurt: silent pass of an irreversible call. The cost asymmetry decides: one
 * pass-through = permanent substrate loss, one refusal = dsh falls back to
 * bili-owned compression (auto pressure, overflow recovery, and manual /compact
 * all send the same envelope and all recover). A fully reworded template
 * degrades to a miss (today's pre-#1729 behavior) — inherent to text matching;
 * the tracked sentence is refreshed per dsh release like MAIN_SYSTEM_PREFIXES
 * tracks Claude Code's system prompts (#970).
 *
 * PROTOCOL COVERAGE (#2360): the whitelist used to read openai/anthropic ONLY.
 * dsh's desktop lane speaks Responses (/v1/responses, /responses/compact), so
 * every compaction call on that wire hit the protocol check and returned
 * false BEFORE the marker was ever examined — the second AND-condition
 * failure after #2193's SHAPE fix (marker-decisive but protocol-blind, and
 * the pass-through stayed completely silent: no warn, no refusal, the exact
 * failure direction #2193 eliminated). All three lanes are now marker-
 * decisive with the same final-user-message rule; each wire contributes its
 * last role=user text (messages[] for openai/anthropic, input[] for
 * responses). Google's contents/parts shape stays out of scope — dsh speaks
 * no Google wire.
 *
 * Deliberately unconditional (auto pressure, context-overflow recovery, and
 * manual /compact all send the same envelope — the traffic layer cannot tell
 * which trigger fired, and a landed checkpoint is equally destructive from
 * any of them). Not gated on the dsh plugin marker: a dsh host routed through
 * a global bili proxy without the plugin bundle must be covered too. Refusal
 * message text intentionally rides into dsh's own warn line
 * ("step compaction failed: <message>; continuing the turn").

/** True when a freshly-LANDED dsh checkpoint is present in the resent history.

 *
 *  A LANDED checkpoint is specifically ONE user-role, plain-text message
 *  (dsh-compaction-basic replaces the shadowed region with a single
 *  user/message whose text starts with CHECKPOINT_PREAMBLE). The framing bytes
 *  are matched as before (open tag anywhere — it sits mid-message after
 *  preamble + blank line; or the preamble at message start). But #2621 taught
 *  that matching the framing BYTES ALONE is a false-positive machine: the
 *  string survives anywhere history QUOTES it — a tool result that read a
 *  transcript containing it, the model citing it in reasoning, bili's own
 *  compress summaries quoting it, an assistant message paraphrasing the
 *  preamble. Those carriers are structurally incapable of being a checkpoint,
 *  so two gates tighten the match to "a checkpoint just landed":
 *
 *   ① CARRIER — the message must be role="user" AND plain text
 *      (contentType "text" when typed). Tool results, reasoning blocks,
 *      tool-call arguments, and assistant prose are excluded outright. On the
 *      Anthropic lane a tool_result rides inside a wire role:"user" message but
 *      flattens to role="tool"/contentType="tool-result" (kernel
 *      anthropicToCore), so the role gate alone already drops it; the
 *      contentType gate is kept as belt-and-suspenders for any lane that maps
 *      a structured user block to a non-text contentType.
 *   ② NOVELTY — the message's raw id must NOT already be in the pre-turn ref
 *      map (`knownIds`, = Object.keys(session.state.messageRefs.byRaw) taken
 *      BEFORE processTurn). A freshly-landed checkpoint is by definition a NEW
 *      message; a historical quote/replay hits an OLD id. This closes the
 *      residual of ①: a user who literally typed/pasted the framing into a
 *      user message in an EARLIER turn is replayed as an old id, not a landing.
 *
 *  Reads the core-flattened text first (BiliMessage/CoreMessage carry prose in
 *  `.text`), falling back to a raw wire content field for direct callers. When
 *  `knownIds` is omitted the novelty gate is skipped (carrier gate only) —
 *  every in-repo caller passes it. */
